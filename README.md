# investigate_no_show_appointments 
It has been worked on dataset collects information from 100k 
medical appointments in Brazil and is focused on the question of whether or not patients show up for their appointment. A number of characteristics about the patient are included in each row. ‘ScheduledDay’ tells us on what day the patient set up their appointment. ‘Neighborhood’ indicates the location of the hospital. ‘Scholarship’ indicates whether or not the patient is enrolled in Brasilian welfare program Bolsa Família. Finally about the last column: it says ‘No’ if the patient showed up to their appointment, and ‘Yes’ if they did not show up. By this dataset I answered these two questions :
<ul>
<li>Are there any trends between day of the week of the scheduled-appointment date and the No-Show rates?</li>
<li>Are there any trends between SMS_received and the no-show rates?</li>
</ul>

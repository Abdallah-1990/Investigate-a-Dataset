In this project,
<ul>
<li>Python was used to work on dataset that collected information from 100k medical appointments in Brazil and was focused on the question of whether or not patients showed up for their appointment.</li> 

<li>A number of characteristics about the patient were included in each row.</li>

<li>‘ScheduledDay’ told us on what day the patient set up their appointment.</li>

<li>‘Neighborhood’ indicated the location of the hospital.</li> 
<li>‘Scholarship’ indicates whether or not the patient is enrolled in Brasilian welfare program Bolsa Família.</li>

<li>Finally about the last column: it says ‘No’ if the patient showed up to their appointment, and ‘Yes’ if they did not show up.</li> 
<li>By this dataset I answered these two questions:</li>
<ol>
<li>Were there any trends between day of the week of the scheduled-appointment date and the No-Show rates?</li>
<li>Were there any trends between SMS_received and the no-show rates?</li>
</ol>
</ul>
